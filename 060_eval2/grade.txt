Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that story-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ story-step3  story-step3.o rand_story.o
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c rand_story.c
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c story-step1.c
gcc -o story-step1 story-step1.o rand_story.o provided.o
rm story-step1.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable story-step1 exists (good)
Checking with provided test case story.txt
Your file matched the expected output
Now running YOUR tests for step 1

1.1: Current test is story-step1 story.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean

Step 2
Checking that story-step2 compiles
rm -f *~ story-step3  story-step3.o rand_story.o
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c rand_story.c
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c story-step2.c
gcc -o story-step2 story-step2.o rand_story.o provided.o
rm story-step2.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable story-step2 exists (good)
Now running YOUR tests for step 2

2.1: Current test is story-step2 words.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean

Step 3
Checking that story-step3 compiles
rm -f *~ story-step3  story-step3.o rand_story.o
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c rand_story.c
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall -Werror -ggdb3 -c story-step3.c
gcc -o story-step3 story-step3.o rand_story.o provided.o
rm story-step3.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable story-step3 exists (good)
Now running YOUR tests for step 3

3.1: Current test is story-step3 words.txt story2.txt
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean

Step 4
Checking that story-step4 compiles
rm -f *~ story-step3  story-step3.o rand_story.o
The code did not compile!
