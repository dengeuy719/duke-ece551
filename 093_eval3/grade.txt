Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step4   cyoa-step4.o page.o story.o
g++  -c page.cpp
g++  -c story.cpp
g++  -c cyoa-step1.cpp
g++ -o cyoa-step1 cyoa-step1.o page.o story.o
rm cyoa-step1.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


1.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


1.3: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story3 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
We considered this a failure case.
But you did not (exit status was EXIT_SUCCESS).
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step4   cyoa-step4.o page.o story.o
g++  -c page.cpp
g++  -c story.cpp
g++  -c cyoa-step2.cpp
g++ -o cyoa-step2 cyoa-step2.o page.o story.o
rm cyoa-step2.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step2 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 2
------------------------------------
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 2

Step 3
Checking that cyoa-step3 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step4   cyoa-step4.o page.o story.o
g++  -c page.cpp
g++  -c story.cpp
g++  -c cyoa-step3.cpp
g++ -o cyoa-step3 cyoa-step3.o page.o story.o
rm cyoa-step3.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step3 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 3
------------------------------------
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 3

Step 4
Checking that cyoa-step4 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step4   cyoa-step4.o page.o story.o
g++  -c page.cpp
g++  -c story.cpp
g++  -c cyoa-step4.cpp
g++ -o cyoa-step4 cyoa-step4.o page.o story.o
rm cyoa-step4.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step4 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 4

You have NOT passed your test cases!
You should go and figure out/understand where thing went wrong
And fix the problem(s) before the deadline
