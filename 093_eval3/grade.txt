Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step4   cyoa-step4.o page.o story.o
g++  -c page.cpp
g++  -c story.cpp
g++  -c cyoa-step1.cpp
g++ -o cyoa-step1 cyoa-step1.o page.o story.o
rm cyoa-step1.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
