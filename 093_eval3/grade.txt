Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step4  cyoa-step3 cyoa-step2  cyoa-step1 cyoa-step4.o cyoa-step3.o cyoa-step2.o cyoa-step1.o page.o story.o
g++  -c page.cpp
g++  -c story.cpp
g++  -c cyoa-step1.cpp
g++ -o cyoa-step1 cyoa-step1.o page.o story.o
rm cyoa-step1.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean


1.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
  - Valgrind was clean (no errors, no memory leaks)
Valgrind was clean
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
rm -f *~ cyoa-step4  cyoa-step3 cyoa-step2  cyoa-step1 cyoa-step4.o cyoa-step3.o cyoa-step2.o cyoa-step1.o page.o story.o
g++  -c page.cpp
g++  -c story.cpp
g++  -c cyoa-step2.cpp
g++ -o cyoa-step2 cyoa-step2.o page.o story.o
rm cyoa-step2.o
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step2 exists (good)
